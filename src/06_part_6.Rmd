# Exercise 6: Advanced Topics

PostgreSQL/PostGIS database environment gives you some powerful capabilities that you should get familiarized step by step.For example triggers can be a valuable asset in enhancing your enterprise GIS environment.

## Creating Triggers for Data Entry Automation

Try to create a Trigger in the database for making the data entries a more seamless process and exploring a bit the possibilities you have.

To create a trigger that calculates the area of a polygon every time it is created, you can follow these steps:

Alter the table "dwellings" to add the "area" column:

::: code-box
``` sql
ALTER TABLE dwellings 
  ADD COLUMN area DOUBLE PRECISION; 
```
:::

Create the trigger function that calculates the area:

::: code-box
``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_area() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.area := ST_Area(NEW.geom);
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql; 
```
:::

Create the trigger on the "dwellings" table that calls the trigger function:

::: code-box
``` sql
CREATE TRIGGER calculate_area_trigger BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON dwellings 
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION calculate_area(); 
```
:::

Now, try to create some new features for the dwellings-table in QGIS. First you need to bring the table again to QGIS, so just erase the Dwellings-table you have in QGIS and load (with e.g. a double click) the table again.

Now that you have set up the trigger, every time a new polygon is inserted or updated in the "dwellings" table (ie. saved in QGIS), the trigger function "calculate_area" will be executed, and the area of the polygon will be automatically calculated and stored in the "area" column of the table.

## Creating some sample data

We can also create some sample data for you to imagine how your database-powered data management process could go for the long-term:

::: code-box
``` sql
INSERT INTO water_distribution_points (capacity, operational_status_id, geom)
SELECT
    floor(random() * 1000) AS capacity,
    floor(random() * 2 + 1) AS operational_status_id,
    ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(
        (random() * (412810.70 - 411685.52) + 411685.52)::numeric(10, 2),
        (random() * (2344064.41 - 2342832.60) + 2342832.60)::numeric(10, 2)
    ), 32646) AS geom
FROM generate_series(1, 1000);
```
:::

As a result, you should many points in the map:
